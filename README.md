# Computational Creativity in Psychogeographical Activities

***The web API used to generate poetry is no longer active.***

A prototype mobile app developed as part of my BSc Computer Science final-year dissertation. [Thesis available here](https://github.com/baysym/bsc/blob/main/thesis.pdf). This project achieved a first-class grade of 76%.

>As users seek more tailored content and computers’ natural language processing skills improve, it is not unreasonable to assume a crossover in which computational creativity is used to meet the demands of the media-consuming public. Recommender systems are already used to offer relevant media to users based on their previous experiences, while artificially intelligent chatbots are well known and widespread across the web. This project develops a mobile application that guides users on a walk and asks them questions about their surroundings. Users’ answers are passed to GPT-3 to generate relevant poetry, which is then displayed to the user. User interviews were undertaken and their findings analysed, suggesting users are keen to interact with computational creativity, in this case agreeing that its use is more enjoyable than the human-created alternative.
